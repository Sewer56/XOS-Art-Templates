# XOS Art Templates

This sample repository contains various of my own templates for various pieces of media I have worked on during the time of my contributions for halogenOS, which are not available within the official media repository. 
These are often seen throughout either the various threads associated with halogenOS or ship alongside the official XOS media in distributions.

- The templates are my own and can be edited with Adobe Photoshop.
- They are absolutely free to use, feel free to share these around or create your own images based off of them.
- While credit is not necessary, it would be appreciated if include it, have fun with the templates!

## Examples:
Various eamples of the available templates are shown below, feel free to customize those to your desire.
The official Android Roboto Thin font has been used in conjunction with the banners as well as the official dark theme colours.
The repository contents contain more templates than the ones shown below, these however are the most commonly used ones throughout XOS.

### Desktop Wallpaper:
The idea about this one being off-centered is that the most commonly used icons would go directly under the logo and text combination, ending up with a relatively nice looking and organized desktop.
