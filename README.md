# XOS Art Templates

This branch of XOS-Art-Templates contains modified versions of the original art templates meant to be used for halogenOS with the Sonic Hacking Contest branding.

Although I, Sewer56 am (at the time of writing) a judge of the SHC at the time of writing, this is not explicitly official SHC art - it is being used as a filler inside an in-progress re-organization of the announcement thread text.

For more details please see the Original branch.
